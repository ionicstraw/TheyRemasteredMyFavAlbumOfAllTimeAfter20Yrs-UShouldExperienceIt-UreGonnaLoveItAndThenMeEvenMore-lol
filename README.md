# TheyRemasteredMyFavAlbumOfAllTimeAfter20Yrs-UShouldExperienceIt-UreGonnaLoveItAndThenMeEvenMore-lol

i dunno too much about supergrass, this is the only album ive listened to from them, its just my favorite, umm if i want to relax, this is what i put on. i dunno i dont take the lyrics too seriously, its just good, i cant explain why. ive been listening to it since it came out 20 yrs ago.

on the wiki page for it, it says https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_to_Rouen the cover art "The front cover photo depicts a cattle bridge near Lefaux, France, that crosses the A16 autoroute, part of the route between Boulogne and Rouen." i want to go there one day, i want to see it in person i dunno why lol
